## General Info
This project is a shortest path finder application that uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two points in a graph. The graph represents a set of cities and the distances between them. The program is modular, with separate files for the main function, Dijkstra's algorithm, and the graph data.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- `heapq` (priority queue implementation)

## Features
- Implements Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph.
- Modular structure for easy maintenance and scalability.
- Displays the shortest route and total distance.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sibobbbbbb/Dijkstra_Algorithm_in_Route_Determination_Shortest_Yogyakarta-Bandung.git
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
    ```bash
    cd Dijkstra_Algorithm_in_Route_Determination_Shortest_Yogyakarta-Bandung
3. Ensure you have Python 3 installed. You can download it from here.
4. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
